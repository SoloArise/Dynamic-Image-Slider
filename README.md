# Dynamic-Image-Slider
This dynamic  image slider built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features an auto-sliding carousel with smooth transitions and a blurred background that adapts to the current slide image.

## Key Features:
-> Auto-Slide: The slider automatically changes slides every 5 seconds, enhancing user engagement.

-> Modern, Responsive Design: The slider is fully responsive, with large, bold, centered text that partially extends outside the slider box. Text is enhanced with strong shadows for readability on all devices.

-> Smooth Transitions: Slides transition smoothly with CSS animations and JavaScript, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used:
